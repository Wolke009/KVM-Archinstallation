# KVM-Qemu-Installation on Arch Linux
A script, so you can install KVM on arch with one command. I guess I will make some changes or extra scripts for a specific distro-installation in KVM.

THIS SCRIPT IS TO OLD AND DONT WORK ANYMORE
At least on my arch linux maschine.
Try it on yours or update the script to ewer standarts...
